# Botmimimi

**Botmimimi** is my personal Discord bot. It is currently a work in progress, as I constantly update it for my own needs. This bot usually consists of me automating things that I feel are repetitive, so it saves me time. Iâ€™ll probably keep adding more stuff as I go â€” whatever I find useful or fun.

## Installation ðŸ’¿

Follow these steps to set up **Botmimimi** on your machine:

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pampamimi/botmimimi.git
    ```
3. Create a `.env.example` file and fill in the required strings
4. Remove `.example` from the file extension so it leaves you with `.env`.
5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command within the bot folder:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
6. Start the bot by running:
    ```
    node .
    ```
